Once you choose your sound track, make a commitment to yourself that you’ll listen to it only when you want to enter Laser mode. Make sure your Laser sound track is something you love to hear; that way, listening to it becomes both a cue and a reward.

Grab a very little bit of salt—a few small crystals—and place it under your tongue. Do not talk, do not move your tongue, and do not drink. Pay attention to what you feel. As the salt enters your blood very fast, it will make you feel either better or worse or you will feel no change.

the first thing a migraineur feels is anxiety, and she feels it often. Anxiety (for a migraineur) is not a separate disease but has the function of alerting the body to start increasing oxygen, so the heart starts pumping faster with increased pulse rate, and the migraineur starts yawning in order to get more air into her lungs.

As the lungs fill with more air and the heart pumps more and richer oxygenated blood, unnecessary body functions shut down. This implies that digestion stops too, so if there is anything undigested in the stomach, it may be vomited up, or if there is anything in the intestinal tract, a very urgent bowel movement (perhaps diarrhea) may follow.

other function is evolutionary. Since migraine itself is a threat and stress response, yawning, to this day, is part of such response in apes and many mammals. It is a sign of power by showing powerful incisors. Notice how when you yawn you show your teeth. This is a prodrome.

If we stimulate a single neuron and no other neuron pays attention (as in a non-migraine-brain), all the effort of that neuron is inhibited, the fire is put out, and not much extra energy is used. When a migraine-brain is stimulated, the activation of the neurons with many more receptor connections pass the signals to a multitude of neurons—the signal will be amplified.

Full moon has bright light ➜ man-eating predators can hunt easier in the bright light of a night with full moon, therefore danger is associated with the full moon ➜ the possibility of danger initiates a stress response and the body releases adrenaline ➜ migraineurs are very alert a few days prior to and during a full moon ➜ in ancient times this was an evolutionary advantage (watching out for predators) ➜ a higher level of adrenaline ties up insulin, preventing glucose from reaching the brain. While alert needs more voltage energy ➜ more voltage energy needs more sodium and nutrition ➜ without extra sodium and nutrition migraine is imminent during full moon.

all migraineurs (probably all, only some may not have noticed it) have one eye becoming smaller than the other prior to a migraine. My personal experience is this: when my right eye gets smaller than the left I need salt, but if it gets bigger, I have too much salt in me and need potassium. This valuable observation relates to neuronal activity specific to managing the muscles of that eye. When the right eye gets smaller, I am running low on voltage in a specific brain area and the affected neurons cannot open the eye properly or hold the muscle of the eye firmly.

Many women take calcium supplements, thinking they will help improve the strength of their bones. The truth, unfortunately, is that they will not. Calcium is a fat-soluble mineral, which means that one must take calcium with some good fat—for example milk or cheese. Calcium taken as a supplement can end up as calcium deposit in arteries instead of strengthening the bones. Calcium supplements can bring with them stroke danger as well

In a multiprogramming environment, several processes may compete for a finite number of resources. A process requests resources; if the resources are not available at that time, the process enters a wait state. It may happen that waiting processes will never again change state, because the resources they have requested are held by other waiting processes. This situation is called deadlock.

Release: The process releases the resource

An alternative method for avoiding deadlocks is to require additional information about how resources are to be requested. For example, in a system with one tape drive and one printer, we might be told that process P will request first the tape drive, and later the printer, before releasing both resources.

Like interleaving, varied practice helps learners build a broad schema, an ability to assess changing conditions and adjust responses to fit. Arguably, interleaving and variation help learners reach beyond memorization to higher levels of conceptual learning and application, building more rounded, deep, and durable learning, what in motor skills shows up as underlying habit strength.

Durable, robust learning requires that we do two things. First, as we recode and consolidate new material from short- term memory into long- term memory, we must anchor it there securely. Second, we must associate the material with a diverse set of cues that will make us adept at recalling the knowledge later.

Learning is at least a three- step pro cess: initial encoding of information is held in short- term working memory before being consolidated into a cohesive repre sen ta tion of knowledge in long- term memory. Consolidation reorganizes and stabilizes memory traces, gives them meaning, and makes connections to past experiences and to other knowledge already stored in long- term memory.

A process is, in essence, a program that is executing. Thus, process-based multitasking is the feature that allows your computer to run two or more programs concurrently. For example, process-based multitasking enables you to run the Java compiler at the same time that you are using a text editor. In process-based multitasking, a program is the smallest unit of code that can be dispatched by the scheduler.

In a thread-based multitasking environment, the thread is the smallest unit of dispatchable code. This means that a single program can perform two or more tasks simultaneously. For instance, a text editor can format text at the same time that it is printing, as long as these two actions are being performed by two separate threads. Thus, process-based multitasking deals with the “big picture,” and thread-based multitasking handles the details.

Java implements an elegant twist on an age-old model of interprocess synchronization: the monitor. The monitor is a control mechanism first defined by C.A.R. Hoare. You can think of a monitor as a very small box that can hold only one thread. Once a thread enters a monitor, all other threads must wait until that thread exits the monitor. In this way, a monitor can be used to protect a shared asset from being manipulated by more than one thread at a time.

Inside get( ), wait( ) is called. This causes its execution to suspend until the Producer notifies you that some data is ready. When this happens, execution inside get( ) resumes. After the data has been obtained, get( ) calls notify( ). This tells Producer that it is okay to put more data in the queue. Inside put( ), wait( ) suspends execution until the Consumer has removed the item from the queue. When execution resumes, the next item of data is put in the queue, and notify( ) is called. This tells the Consumer that it should now remove it.

The suspend( ) method of the Thread class is deprecated in Java 2. This was done because suspend( ) can sometimes cause serious system failures. Assume that a thread has obtained locks on critical data structures. If that thread is suspended at that point, those locks are not relinquished. Other threads that may be waiting for those resources can be deadlocked.
